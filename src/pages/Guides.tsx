        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Getting Started in Research</h1>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
          Whether you're just curious or already determined to dive into research, this guide will walk you through the steps to get started at UH. Research isn't just for graduate students or pre-med majors - it's for anyone who wants to explore, create, and contribute to knowledge.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg mb-8">
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">Why Research Matters</h3>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            Research experience builds critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and gives you hands-on experience that can't be learned in textbooks. It also opens doors to graduate school, scholarships, and career opportunities you might not have considered.
          </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">1. Identify Your Interests</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Start by exploring areas you're genuinely curious about. These don't have to align with your major - some of the most innovative research happens at the intersection of different disciplines. Ask yourself: What problems in the world genuinely bother you? What questions keep you up at night?
        </p>

          <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Try this exercise:</h4>
          <ul className="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-1">
            <li>• Write down 5 topics you find fascinating (even if they seem unrelated to your major)</li>
            <li>• List 3 global or local problems you care about</li>
            <li>• Think about your favorite classes - what made them engaging?</li>
            <li>• Consider what you do in your free time - could any of it be researched?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">2. Explore Research Labs</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Use this site to browse UH research labs, but don't stop there. Look at recent publications, lab websites, or posters presented at events to understand their work. Visit department websites, attend research presentations, and check out the Undergraduate Research Day if UH hosts one.
        </p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
          <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Research detective tips:</h4>
          <ul className="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-1">
            <li>• Check professor profiles on department websites</li>
            <li>• Look up recent publications on Google Scholar</li>
            <li>• Attend department seminars and guest lectures</li>
            <li>• Talk to upperclassmen about their research experiences</li>
            <li>• Visit labs during open houses or research fairs</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">3. Reach Out</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Email professors or graduate students with a thoughtful message expressing your interest. Be clear about what you hope to learn or contribute. Don't be discouraged if you don't hear back immediately - professors get many emails, and it's not personal.
        </p>
        <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
          <h4 className="font-medium mb-2 text-yellow-900">Before you email:</h4>
          <ul className="text-sm text-yellow-800 space-y-1">
            <li>• Read at least one of their recent papers (even if you don't understand everything)</li>
            <li>• Check if they're currently taking students (some lab websites mention this)</li>
            <li>• Consider reaching out to graduate students first - they're often more accessible</li>
            <li>• Have a clear idea of your time commitment and goals</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">4. Be Open and Persistent</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Many students begin by volunteering or assisting on small tasks. That's not just okay - it's normal and valuable. Use this time to learn, grow, and see where it takes you. Don't expect to be running your own experiments on day one.
        </p>
        <div className="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
          <h4 className="font-medium mb-2 text-green-900">What to expect as a new researcher:</h4>
          <ul className="text-sm text-green-800 space-y-1">
            <li>• You might start with literature reviews or data entry</li>
            <li>• Learning lab techniques takes time - be patient with yourself</li>
            <li>• Ask questions, even if they seem basic</li>
            <li>• Keep a research notebook to track what you learn</li>
            <li>• Celebrate small victories - every skill you gain matters</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">5. Make It Official</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Once you've found a good fit, consider formalizing your research experience. This could mean enrolling in research credits, applying for undergraduate research grants, or joining research programs like the Honors College research track.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">6. Think Long-term</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Research is a marathon, not a sprint. Consider how this experience fits into your broader goals. Are you interested in graduate school? Industry? Professional school? Different paths may require different research approaches and timelines.
        </p>
